name: Thermonuclear Silo
description: Your hands are hovering above the button , one capable of decieving you from the countless millions of casualties . Have you wished to do such heinous crimes ? Or is it just another of your hobbies ? We all know what will happen because of that button , because of that one single button , one that holds the fate of trillions in one single press . Perhaps , it is time for the End Times to happen , now that your ultimate goal has been achieved . A path of genocide and insanity , led by a pyscho in the search of glory ...
details: "Only when it is armageddon , shall we see our foolishness to start such wars . At the end of timelines , we seek and find their demise , to see their once utopian society , now reduced to a smoking crater , filled with radioactivity , nuclear winters , black sludges , ashes of once tall building , and the most common , a barren wasteland , devoid of all life but the utter crimes against one another ."
